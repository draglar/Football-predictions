# Football-predictions
Predicting the outcomes of matches given different features

## Using a Polynomial regresion model to predict the number of goals scored by either the home team or away team
## Using a Logistic Regression to predict a win, loss or draw

for the prediction in the notebook
> rank of home team=15


> rank of away team=32


> in a friendly match


chances to score
> home team =1.5 : chance for scoring one goal is 100% and a 50 % chance to score a second goal


>away team =0.8 : chance for scoring one goal is 80%


>Home team wins 😁
.... ITs still a decent working progress
